## Required Input

Before using this skill, you must provide:

### 1. Optimized Detailed Outline
**Required structure**:
```markdown
## Abstract (250-300 words)
- [Key points to cover]

## 1. Introduction (1,500 words)
### 1.1 Opening Puzzle (400 words)
- [Content guidance]
### 1.2 Literature Review (600 words)
- [Theories to discuss]
### 1.3 This Paper's Contribution (500 words)
- [Specific claims]

## 2. [Main Chapter Title] (1,200 words)
### 2.1 [Section] (400 words)
- [Argument structure]
- [Key citations]
...

[Complete structure with word counts and content guidance]
```

**Quality check**: Outline should specify:
- ✓ Chapter titles and word counts
- ✓ Subsection structure (to 3rd level)
- ✓ Content guidance for each section
- ✓ Key citations to include
- ✓ Argument structure notes

If outline lacks these, consider using **academic-paper-strategist** first.

### 2. Platform Writing Standards Guide
**From academic-paper-strategist Phase 1**, or equivalent document specifying:
- Platform style patterns (voice, terminology, citation format)
- Structural conventions
- Example papers for reference

### 3. Literature Base (Optional but Recommended)
- List of core papers to cite
- Research gap analysis
- Key concepts to emphasize

---

## Phase 4: Systematic Writing

### Goal
Write complete manuscript chapter-by-chapter with iterative quality control.

### Workflow

#### Step 4.1: Writing Environment Setup

Before writing, I will:

1. **Verify outline completeness**:
   - All chapters specified with word counts
   - Content guidance provided
   - Argument structure clear

2. **Load reference documents**:
   - Platform writing standards
   - Section writing guides (`references/section_guides.md`)
   - Quality standards (`references/writing_standards.md`)

3. **Create writing tracker**:
   ```markdown
   # Writing Progress Tracker
   - [ ] Abstract (250 words)
   - [ ] Chapter 1: Introduction (1,500 words)
   - [ ] Chapter 2: [Title] (1,200 words)
   ...
   - [ ] Conclusion (1,000 words)
   - [ ] References
   ```

**Decision Point 1**: Confirm outline and standards loaded, ready to begin writing.

#### Step 4.2: Chapter-by-Chapter Writing

**For each chapter, I will follow this sequence**:

##### A. Pre-Writing Review
Before writing chapter N:
1. **Review outline specification** for this chapter:
   - Word count target
   - Subsection structure
   - Content guidance
   - Key arguments/citations

2. **Review previous chapter** (if N>1):
   - Last paragraph of chapter N-1
   - Key concepts introduced
   - Promises to fulfill

3. **Check section guide**:
   - Load appropriate template from `references/section_guides.md`
   - Review quality markers for this section type

##### B. Writing Execution

I will write the chapter following:

**Content principles**:
- **Follow outline exactly**: Respect structure and word counts
- **Include specified citations**: Use literature from outline
- **Maintain platform style**: Match voice and terminology
- **Use section templates**: Follow appropriate guide from `references/section_guides.md`

**Quality targets (pre-emptive)**:
- Argument quality: Clear thesis, justified premises
- Citation quality: All claims supported, proper format
- Clarity: Precise prose, terms defined, good transitions
- Structure: Logical flow, proper proportions
- Style conformity: Match platform conventions

**Output**: Complete chapter draft

##### C. Post-Writing Evaluation

After completing chapter draft, I will:

1. **Run mechanical chapter checks** (script):
   ```bash
   python scripts/chapter_quality_check.py --chapter <chapter.md> --target-words <N> [--json report.json]
   ```

   The script checks word count (±10% PASS / ±20% WARN vs `--target-words`),
   structure completeness, figure/table/equation reference existence,
   placeholder residue (TODO/待补/`{{...}}` → FAIL), and paragraph balance,
   printing a per-item PASS/WARN/FAIL report (exit code 1 on any FAIL).

2. **Perform 5-dimension assessment** (agent judgment, per `references/writing_standards.md` — the script cannot score these qualitative dimensions):
   - **Argument Quality** (1-4): Thesis clear? Premises justified? Objections addressed?
   - **Citation Quality** (1-4): All claims cited? Format consistent? Key literature included?
   - **Clarity & Readability** (1-4): Prose clear? Terms defined? Transitions smooth?
   - **Structure & Flow** (1-4): Logical progression? Proper proportions? Follows outline?
   - **Platform Conformity** (1-4): Style match? Voice consistent? Format correct?

3. **Combine into quality report**:
   - Total score (X/20) from the 5 agent-scored dimensions
   - Pass/fail (threshold: ≥16/20) — plus no FAIL items from the script report
   - Weak dimensions identified
   - Specific revision recommendations

**Quality Gate 4A** (After Each Chapter):
- ✓ Score ≥16/20 (80%)
- ✓ All dimensions ≥3/4 (or revisions implemented)
- ✓ Word count within ±10% of target

**If Failed**: Implement revisions before proceeding to next chapter

##### D. Iteration (If Needed)

If chapter scores <16/20:

1. **Identify weak dimension(s)**: Which scored <3/4?

2. **Implement targeted revisions**:
   - Argument quality issue → Add justifications, address objections
   - Citation quality issue → Add supporting citations, fix format
   - Clarity issue → Simplify prose, add definitions, improve transitions
   - Structure issue → Reorganize paragraphs, adjust proportions
   - Style issue → Adjust voice, terminology, format

3. **Re-evaluate**: Generate new quality report

4. **Repeat until passing** (typically 1-2 iterations)

**Important**: Do not proceed to next chapter until current chapter passes quality gate.

##### E. Chapter Completion

Once chapter passes quality gate:

1. **Mark chapter complete** in writing tracker
2. **Save chapter with quality report**
3. **Note key concepts introduced** (for coherence check later)
4. **Preview next chapter** requirements

**Decision Point 2** (After Major Chapters): After completing each main body chapter, I will:
- Present completed chapter summary
- Show quality score
- Ask: Proceed to next chapter or revise further?

#### Step 4.3: Writing Sequence

**Recommended order**:

1. **Introduction** (write first)
   - Establishes thesis and roadmap
   - Use introduction guide from `references/section_guides.md`
   - Quality check: Abstract promises, literature coverage, clear contribution

2. **Main Body Chapters** (in outline order)
   - Follow outline sequence
   - Quality check after each
   - Build on previous chapters

3. **Conclusion** (write after main body)
   - Synthesizes findings
   - Addresses introduction promises
   - Use conclusion guide from `references/section_guides.md`

4. **Abstract** (write last)
   - Summarizes complete paper
   - Use abstract guide from `references/section_guides.md`
   - Quality check: Standalone, accurate, compelling

5. **References** (compile throughout)
   - Format according to platform standards
   - Verify all citations present

#### Step 4.4: Cross-Chapter Coherence Check

After all chapters written, before final evaluation:

1. **Terminology consistency**:
   - Extract key terms from each chapter
   - Verify consistent usage throughout
   - Check definitions consistent

2. **Argument flow**:
   - Verify chapter N+1 builds on chapter N
   - Check roadmap (intro) matches execution
   - Ensure conclusion addresses introduction promises

3. **Citation patterns**:
   - Check for uneven citation distribution
   - Verify key works cited where relevant
   - Ensure bibliography complete

**Output**: Cross-chapter coherence report identifying any inconsistencies

---

## Phase 5: Quality Control

### Goal
Perform comprehensive final evaluation and prepare submission-ready manuscript.

### Workflow

#### Step 5.1: Content Completeness Check

Using structured checklist, verify:

**Structural Completeness**:
- [ ] Abstract (250-300 words)
- [ ] Introduction with all required elements
- [ ] All outlined main chapters present
- [ ] Conclusion with all required elements
- [ ] References section formatted correctly

**Content Completeness**:
- [ ] All introduction promises fulfilled
- [ ] All claims supported by evidence or argument
- [ ] All technical terms defined
- [ ] All objections addressed
- [ ] All limitations acknowledged

**Citation Completeness**:
- [ ] Every citation in text has bibliography entry
- [ ] Every bibliography entry cited in text
- [ ] Citation format consistent throughout
- [ ] All citations include necessary information

**Format Completeness**:
- [ ] Title page (if required)
- [ ] Section numbering consistent
- [ ] Heading hierarchy logical
- [ ] Figure/table captions (if applicable)

**Output**: Completeness checklist report

#### Step 5.2: Final 7-Dimension Evaluation

I will perform comprehensive evaluation. Mechanical dimensions are scored by script:

```bash
python scripts/final_evaluation.py --paper <full_paper.md> [--min-words 5000] [--max-words 12000] [--json final_eval.json]
```

The script scores 4 mechanically-checkable dimensions (structure completeness,
word count, figure/table counts, citation completeness; 10 points each, pass
≥32/40) and outputs JSON + console summary. The 7 qualitative dimensions below
are evaluated by the agent per `references/writing_standards.md`.

**7 Dimensions** (10 points each, 70 total):

1. **Overall Argument Quality** (1-10)
   - Thesis clarity throughout
   - Chapter integration
   - Logical completeness
   - Objections addressed

2. **Literature Integration** (1-10)
   - Citation count (40-60 typical for philosophy)
   - Key literature covered
   - Citations well-integrated
   - Critical engagement present

3. **Clarity & Accessibility** (1-10)
   - Prose clarity
   - Complex ideas explained
   - Appropriate for audience
   - Technical terms defined

4. **Originality & Contribution** (1-10)
   - Clear original contribution
   - Advance over literature
   - Significance established
   - Innovation present

5. **Methodological Rigor** (1-10)
   - Method explicit and justified
   - Consistently applied
   - Appropriate for question
   - Limitations acknowledged

6. **Structure & Organization** (1-10)
   - Logical flow
   - Optimal organization
   - Proportions balanced
   - Transitions seamless

7. **Platform & Style Conformity** (1-10)
   - Style matches platform
   - Format correct
   - Voice consistent
   - Citation format perfect

**Scoring Process**:
1. Evaluate each dimension (1-10)
2. Provide detailed notes for each
3. Complete completeness checklist
4. List any specific issues

**Generate report** (agent combines script JSON + 7-dimension qualitative scores):

This produces:
- Total score (X/70)
- Pass/fail (threshold: ≥56/70)
- Weak dimensions identified
- Completeness assessment
- Prioritized revision recommendations
- Submission readiness decision

**Quality Gate 5** (Final):
- ✓ Score ≥56/70 (80%)
- ✓ All completeness checklist items complete
- ✓ All high-priority issues addressed

**If Failed**: Implement revisions and re-evaluate

#### Step 5.3: Revision Implementation (If Needed)

If final score <56/70 or completeness incomplete:

1. **Prioritize revisions**:
   - HIGH priority: All issues affecting score or completeness
   - MEDIUM priority: Issues improving quality
   - LOW priority: Optional enhancements

2. **Implement systematically**:
   - Address high-priority first
   - Document changes
   - Maintain style consistency

3. **Re-evaluate**:
   - Generate new final report
   - Verify score ≥56/70
   - Check completeness 100%

4. **Iterate until passing**

**Decision Point 3**: After final evaluation, I will:
- Present final score and assessment
- Show submission readiness status
- Recommend: Submit immediately / Implement optional improvements / Required revisions
- Ask: Proceed with submission or implement further improvements?

#### Step 5.4: Submission Package Preparation

Once final evaluation passes:

1. **Platform-specific checklist**:
   - **PhilArchive/PhilPapers**:
     - [ ] PDF format
     - [ ] Abstract <500 words
     - [ ] Metadata (title, keywords, classification)
     - [ ] Author information complete

   - **arXiv**:
     - [ ] LaTeX or PDF format
     - [ ] Abstract <1920 characters

## Quality Assurance System

### Quality Standards Reference

For detailed evaluation criteria, all standards are defined in:
```markdown
references/writing_standards.md
```

This document provides:
- Chapter-level quality standards (5 dimensions)
- Final quality standards (7 dimensions)
- Section-specific quality criteria
- Scoring rubrics
- Issue identification and fixes

### Section Writing Guides

For guidance on writing each section type:
```markdown
references/section_guides.md
```

This provides:
- Abstract writing template and checklist
- Introduction structure (6 subsections)
- Main body chapter templates (4 types)
- Conclusion structure
- Transition strategies
- Platform-specific style guidance
- Common mistakes and fixes

### Evaluation Scripts

Two Python scripts support quality validation:

#### 1. Chapter Quality Check
```bash
python scripts/chapter_quality_check.py --chapter <chapter.md> --target-words <N> [--json report.json]
```

**Function**: Mechanical per-chapter checks with per-item PASS/WARN/FAIL report
- Word count vs outline target (±10% PASS / ±20% WARN)
- Structure completeness (headings present, no level skips, no empty sections)
- Figure/table/equation reference existence (incl. image path existence)
- Placeholder residue (TODO / 待补 / `{{...}}` etc. → FAIL)
- Paragraph balance (overlong / fragmented paragraphs)
- Exit code: 0 = no FAIL, 1 = has FAIL, 2 = usage/IO error

**Note**: The 5-dimension qualitative scoring (argument/citation/clarity/structure/style, X/20) is performed by the agent per `references/writing_standards.md`; this script covers only the mechanically checkable part.

**When to Use**: After writing each chapter (Step 4.2.C)

#### 2. Final Paper Evaluation
```bash
python scripts/final_evaluation.py --paper <full_paper.md> [--min-words 5000] [--max-words 12000] [--json final_eval.json]
```

**Function**: Scores the complete paper on 4 mechanical dimensions (10 points each, 40 total, pass ≥32)
- Structure completeness (abstract / introduction / conclusion / references + body chapter count)
- Word count vs `--min-words`/`--max-words` range
- Figure & table counts + dangling 图N/表N reference detection
- Citation completeness (bibliography entries vs in-text `[n]` citations, broken-link detection)
- Outputs JSON score report (stdout or `--json` path) + console summary

**Note**: The 7-dimension qualitative evaluation (argument quality, originality, methodological rigor, etc., X/70) is performed by the agent per `references/writing_standards.md`; this script covers only the mechanically checkable part.

**When to Use**: After all chapters complete (Step 5.2)
