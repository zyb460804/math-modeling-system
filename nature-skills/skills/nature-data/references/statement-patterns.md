# Statement Patterns

Use these patterns as starting points. Replace bracketed fields with verified information. Delete
any sentence that does not apply.

For Chinese users, treat the Chinese line under each pattern as author-facing guidance, not as
submission text. Submit the English statement unless the journal explicitly asks otherwise.

## Public repository, single dataset

```text
The [raw/processed/source] data supporting the findings of this study are available in
[Repository] under accession [ACCESSION] / at [DOI or persistent URL]. The deposited record
contains [brief contents: e.g. raw measurements, processed tables, figure source data, metadata
and analysis inputs].
```

中文对应：本研究的原始/处理后/源数据已存储在某个正式仓库，并有登录号、DOI 或永久链接。

## Public repository, multiple datasets

```text
The datasets generated in this study are available as follows: [dataset family 1] in
[Repository] under [DOI/accession]; [dataset family 2] in [Repository] under [DOI/accession];
and figure source data in [Repository/Supplementary Data file] under [identifier or file name].
```

中文对应：不同类型数据分别放在不同仓库或文件中，需要逐一说明，不能笼统写“数据见附件”。

## Data in paper and supplementary files only

Use only when the supporting dataset is genuinely small and fully represented in the article,
source data, or supplementary files.

```text
All data supporting the findings of this study are included in the paper, its Supplementary
Information, and Source Data files. [Name exact Supplementary Tables/Data files when possible.]
```

中文对应：只有当支撑结论的数据确实都在正文、补充材料和 Source Data 中时才这样写。

## Reused public data

```text
This study used publicly available [dataset name/type] from [Repository or source], available under
[DOI/accession/stable URL]. We used [version/release/date accessed, if relevant]. No new primary
[data type] data were generated for this part of the analysis.
```

中文对应：使用公开数据库时，需要写清数据库名、版本/发布日期/访问日期和编号，并引用数据集。

## Mixed generated and reused data

```text
Data generated in this study are available in [Repository] under [DOI/accession]. Public datasets
reused in the analysis were obtained from [source 1, identifier/version] and [source 2,
identifier/version]. Source data for [figures/tables] are provided in [location].
```

中文对应：自己产生的数据和复用的公开数据要分开写，避免让读者误以为所有数据都是本研究产生。

## Controlled-access human or sensitive data

```text
The [data type] data supporting this study are not publicly available because [privacy, consent,
legal, ethical or security reason]. A metadata record is available at [repository/accession, if
available]. Qualified researchers may request access from [data access committee/institutional
office/repository procedure] at [contact or URL]. Access requires [ethics approval/data-use
agreement/other conditions] and will be reviewed according to [policy or committee name].
```

中文对应：涉及人类参与者、隐私或伦理限制时，不能只写“因隐私不可公开”；还要写申请路径和审核条件。

## Third-party or licensed data

```text
The [data type/name] data used in this study were obtained from [third-party provider] under
licence and are not publicly redistributable by the authors. Requests for access should be directed
to [provider/contact/URL]. Derived data that can be shared are available in [repository] under
[DOI/accession], subject to [licence or restriction].
```

中文对应：第三方授权数据不能由作者重新分发时，要说明数据所有者和读者应向谁申请。

## Commercially restricted data

```text
The [data type] data are subject to commercial restrictions and cannot be made publicly available.
Requests for access may be directed to [company/data owner/contact or URL] and are subject to
[approval/licence/payment/confidentiality terms]. The authors provide [summary statistics,
metadata, synthetic data, or source data] in [location] to support interpretation of the results.
```

中文对应：企业或商业数据不可公开时，需要说明商业限制、申请对象，以及是否有汇总数据或元数据可公开。

## Embargoed data

Use only when the repository supports embargo and the journal permits it.

```text
The [data type] data have been deposited in [Repository] under [DOI/accession] and are under
embargo until [date/event]. Reviewers can access the data using [private reviewer link or
repository access route]. The data will become publicly available at [DOI/accession] when the
embargo ends.
```

中文对应：如果数据暂时不公开，必须已有仓库记录、审稿访问方式和明确解封时间或条件。

## Request-based access with justified restriction

```text
The [data type] data are not publicly available because [specific reason]. Requests for access may
be sent to [institutional group/contact route], and will be considered for [eligible purpose/users]
subject to [approval, agreement, or legal condition]. [Public metadata/aggregate data/source data]
are available at [location].
```

中文对应：“合理请求”只有在说明原因、接收机构、审核条件和可公开元数据后才可接受。

## No datasets generated or analysed

Use sparingly.

```text
No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.
```

中文对应：只有确实没有生成或分析任何数据时才能使用，经验研究通常不适用。

For theory papers, be more specific:

```text
This work is theoretical and does not generate or analyse empirical datasets.
```

## Anti-patterns to revise

| Weak wording | Why it fails | Stronger move |
|---|---|---|
| Data are available upon request. | No reason, route, eligibility, or durability. | Add restriction reason, responsible access body, conditions, and metadata. |
| Data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. | Often a literal translation of "可向通讯作者合理索取"; not durable or specific enough. | Use an institutional/repository access route and define review conditions. |
| Data will be uploaded after acceptance. | No current repository or durable identifier. | Deposit before submission or provide a private reviewer link. |
| All data are in the manuscript. | Often false for figures/statistics. | Name exact source data, supplementary files, and omitted raw data. |
| Data are proprietary. | Does not say who controls access. | Name owner/provider and access route. |
| N/A. | Nature-style instructions usually require an explanation. | State why no datasets were generated or analysed. |

## Audit questions

- Which result would fail if this dataset were unavailable?
- Is the route durable beyond the corresponding author's current email address?
- Can a reader tell what each identifier contains?
- Are restrictions specific enough for an editor to judge them?
- Are reused datasets cited, not merely mentioned?
